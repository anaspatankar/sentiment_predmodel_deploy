# Sentiment Analysis Model Deployment 

Implemented a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a
movie review using a dataset of text from IMdB. 

Deployed this model using Amazon SageMaker. 

After deploying your model, constructed a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model and categorize any new, input review.
